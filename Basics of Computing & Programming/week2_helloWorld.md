# Week 2: Hello World

In computer science, we design algorithms to solve computational problems. We then implement them in a formal programming language which would be executed by a computer.

When stating a computational problem:

- Define set of legal inputs
- Define the required output for each input

Example:

- The Sorting Problem <br>
  - Input: a sequence of numbers `<a1, a2 ..., an>` <br>
  - Output: a reordering `<b1, b2, ..., bn>` of the input sequence such that: `b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bn`

`Algorithm` is a well-defined computational procedure that describes how to transform a given input to a desired output; a set of instructions.

**Executing a program:** <br>
Program (algorithm) gets copied from secondary memory (hard-drive) to RAM (faster memory), then repeating cycles:

1. Fetch instruction from RAM to CPU at specific address
2. Decode instruction
3. Execute instruction
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until program is executed

**Build process:** <br>
Humans use high-level programming languages, like Python, that get translated to machine language (binary) to communicate instructions to computers.

Two kinds of translations (some languages are compilation-based, others interpretation-based):

- Compilation (ex: C, C++)
  - Program is taken as whole and then translated
- Interpretation (ex: Python)
  - Each expression is translated, one-by-one

Input and Output:

- Inputs (variables or functions) are saved in memory and may be called upon for future program execution.
