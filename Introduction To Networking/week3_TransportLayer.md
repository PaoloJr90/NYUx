# Week 3: Transport Layer

Transport Services and Protocols

- Provide logical communication between app processes running on different hosts
- Transport protocols run in end systems
  - Send side: breaks app messages into segments, passes to network layer
  - Receive side: reassembles segments into messages, passes to app layer
- More than one transport protocol available to apps
  - Internet: TCP and UDP

**TCP: Transmission Control Protocol**

- Reliable, in-order delivery - Congestion control - Flow control - Connection setup "handshake"
  UDP: User Datagram Protocol
- No-frill extension of "best-effort" IP
  - Really fast
- Services not available:
  - Delay guarantees
  - Bandwidth guarantees

Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

![](./images/week3/multi_demulti.png)

How Demultiplexing Works

![demulti](./images/week3/demulti.png)

Connectionless Demultiplexing (used by DNS protocol)

- When host receives UDP segment:
  - Checks destination port # in segment
  - Directs UDP segment to socket with that port #
- IP datagrams with same destination port #, but different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers will be directed to same socket at destination

![demulti_example](./images/week3/demulti_example.png)

Connection-Oriented Demux (Demultiplexing)

- TCP socket identified by 4-tuple:
  1. Source IP address
  2. Source port number
  3. Destination IP address
  4. Destination port number
- Server host may support many simultaneous TCP sockets: each socket identified by its own 4-tuple
- Web servers have different sockets for each connecting client
  - Non-persistent HTTP will have different socket for each request

Example:
![demulti_example1](./images/week3/demulti_example1.png)

Connectionless Transport: UDP

- Connectionless:
  - No handshaking between UDP sender & receiver
  - Each UDP segment handled independently of others
- UDP use:
  - Streaming multimedia apps (less tolerant, rate sensitive)
  - DNS
- "Best effort" service
  - UDP segments may be:
    - Lost
    - Delivered out-of-order to app
- Very fast speeds!

Principles of Reliable Data Transfer

- Ensure certain applications have a guaranteed delivery of packets (data)

![data_transfer](./images/week3/data_transfer.png)

![data_transfer1](./images/week3/data_transfer1.png)

SMTP, HTTP require reliable channel to move packets from source to destination
Knowing that networks may be unreliable, we have to build mechanisms inside protocols to ensure reliability of delivery

RDT: Getting started

![RDT](./images/week3/RDT.png)

Dependency between the "event" and the "state"

- Define which event caused a transition from one state to the next

RDT 1.0: Reliable transfer over a reliable channel

- Underlying channel perfectly reliable
  - No bit errors
  - No loss of packets
- Separate FSMs for send, receiver:
  - Senders sends data into underlying channel
  - Receiver reads data from underlying channel

RDT 2.0: Channel with Bit Errors

- Underlying channel may flip bits in packet (ex: electromagnetic interference (EMI) or other natural forces)
  - Checksum to detect bit
- The question: how to recover from errors?
  - Acknowledgments (ACKs): receiver explicitly tells sender that packet received OK
  - Negative acknowledgments (NAKs): receiver explicitly tells sender that packet had errors
  - Sender retransmits packet on receipt of NAK
- Has a fatal flaw!
  - What happens if ACK/NAK is corrupted?
    - Sender doesn't know what happened at receiver!
    - Can't just retransmit: possible duplicate
  - Handling duplicates:
    - Sender retransmits current packet if ACK/NAK corrupted
    - Sender adds sequence number to each packet
    - Receiver discards (doesn't deliver up) duplicate packet
  - Stop and wait
    - Sender sends on packet, then wait for receiver response

RDT 2.1: Discussion
Sender:

- Sequence # added to packet
- Two sequence #s (0,1) will suffice - stop and wait operation
- Must check if received ACK/NAK corrupted
- Twice as many states - State must "remember" whether "expected" packet should have sequence # of 0 or 1

  Receiver:

- Must check if received packet is duplicate
  - State indicates whether 0 or 1 is expected packet sequence #
- Note: receive can not know if its last ACK/NAK received OK at sender

RDT 2.2: a NAK-free protocol

- Same functionality as RDT2.1, using ACKs only
- Instead of NAK, receiver sends ACK for last packet received OK
  - Receiver must explicitly include sequence number of packet being ACKed
- Duplicate ACK at sender results in same action as NAK: retransmit current packet

RDT 3.0: Channels with Errors and Loss <br>
New assumption:

- Underlying channel can also lose packets (data, ACKs) - Checksum, sequence #, ACKs, retransmissions will be of help...but not enough

  Approach:

- Sender waits "reasonable" amount of time for ACK
- Retransmits if no ACK received in this time

- If packet (or ACK) just delayed (not lost):
  - Retransmission will be duplicate, but sequence #s already handles this
  - Receiver must specify sequence # of packet being ACKed
- Requires countdown timer

![sender_receiver](./images/week3/sender_receiver.png)

Performance of RDT 3.0

- RDT 3.0 is correct, but performance is poor
- Ex: 1 Gbps link, 15 ms propagation delay, 8000 bit packet:
  - Dtrans = L/R = (8000 bits)/(10^9 bits/sec)=8 Î¼s
  - Usender: utilization - fraction of time sender busy
  - Usender = (L/R)/(RTT+L/R)=0.008/30.008=0.00027
  - If RTT = 30 millisecond, 1KB packet every 30 millisecond: 33kB/second throughput over 1Gbps link

Improving RDT protocols performance: <br>
Introduce "pipelining"

- Sender going to allow multiple "in-flight", but yet-to-be-acknowledged packets in the transmission
  - As if we are "stuffing" the line with information without waiting for each packet's acknowledgment
- Two generic forms:
  - Go-Back-N
  - Selective N

![pipelining](./images/week3/pipelining.png)

Pipelined Protocols: Overview

Go-back-N:

- Sender can have up to N unacked packets in pipeline
- Receiver only sends cumulative ack
  - Doesn't ack packet if there's a gap
- Sender has timer for oldest unacked packet
  - When timer expires, retransmit all unacked packets

Selective Repeat:

- Sender can have up to N unacked packets in pipeline
- Receiver sends individual ack for each packet
- Sender maintains time for each unacked packet
  - When timer expires, retransmit only that unacked packet

![go_back_n](./images/week3/go_back_n.png)
![gbn_action](./images/week3/gbn_action.png)

Selective Repeat

- Receiver individually acknowledges all correctly received packets
  - Buffers packets as needed, for eventual in-order delivery to upper layer
- Sender only resends packets for which ACK not received
  - Sender timer for each unacked packet
- Sender window
  - N-consecutive sequence numbers
  - Limits sequence numbers of sent, unacked packets

TCP Overview:

RFCs: 793, 1122, 1323, 2018, 2581

- Point-to-point:
  - One sender, one receiver
- Reliable, in-order byte stream:
  - No "message boundaries"
  - Packets sent/received (by application layer) in same order
- Pipelined:
  - TCP congestion and flow control sets window size
- Full duplex data:
  - Bi-directional data flow in same connection
  - MSS: maximum segment size
- Connection-oriented:
  - Handshaking (exchange of control messages), inits sender, receiver state before data exchange
- Flow-controlled:
  - Sender will not overwhelm receiver

![tcp_segment](./images/week3/tcp_segment.png)

TCP sequence numbers & acknowledgment numbers

Sequence:

- Byte stream "number" of first byte in segment's data

Acknowledgment:

- Sequence # of next byte expected from other side
- Cumulative ACK

TCP Round Trip Time, Timeout

Q: How to set TCP timeout value?

- Longer than RTT - but RTT varies
- Too short: premature timeout, unnecessary transmissions
- Too long: slow reaction to segment loss

Q: how to estimate RTT?

- Sample RTT: measured time from segment transmission until ACK receipt
  - Ignore retransmissions
- Sample RTT will vary, want estimated RTT "smoother"
  - Average several recent measurements, not just current Sample RTT

TCP: Retransmission Scenarios

![tcp_retransmit](./images/week3/tcp_retransmit.png)

TCP ACK Generation feature (RFC 1122, RFC 2581)

![tcp_ack](./images/week3/tcp_ack.png)

TCP Fast Retransmit (TCP feature)
If sender receives 3 ACKs for same data ("triple duplicate ACKs"), resend unacked segment with smallest sequence #

- Likely that unacked segment lost, so don't wait for timeout

![tcp_fast_retransmit](./images/week3/tcp_fast_retransmit.png)

TCP Flow Control:

Receiver controls sender, so sender won't overflow receiver's buffer space by transmitting too much, too fast

![tcp_flow_control](./images/week3/tcp_flow_control.png)

rwnd = receiver window

TCP: Closing a connection (FINbit = Final Bit)

![tcp_finbit](./images/week3/tcp_finbit.png)

Principles of Congestion Control
Congestion:

- Informally: "too many sources sending too much data too fast for network to handle"
- Different from flow control
- Manifestations:
  - Lost packets (buffer overflow at routers)
  - Long delays (queueing in router buffers)
- Another "cost" of congestion:
  - When packet dropped, any "upstream" transmission capacity user for that packet was wasted.
    - The line will sit idle and unused

TCP Congestion Control

1. Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)
   - Approach: sender increases transmission rate (window size), probing for usable bandwidth, until loss occurs

![tcp_congestion](./images/week3/tcp_congestion.png)

2. TCP Slow Start
